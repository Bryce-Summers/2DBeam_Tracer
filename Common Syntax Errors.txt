if is common for me to write a function as:

foo() ->

which is not caught by the coffeescript interpreter.

it should instead be written as:

foo: () ->


the @ sign must not be ommitted to ensure proper internal class scoping.


always put the trailing '()' braces after a function call, because otherwise it assumes you want the function and the function is true when you are conditioning on the return value.

--> Always Use foo(), not foo.


Make sure to spell thinks like isEmissiveSource correctly.
